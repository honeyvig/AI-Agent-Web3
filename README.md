# AI-Agent-Web3
NL - SQL agent at core

Identifies user requirements, fetches data via api or db.
Can interact with blockchain if required by user.
--------
Creating a Web3-based Python application with an SQL agent that can interact with a blockchain requires several core components:

    SQL Agent: This component will fetch data from an SQL database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) based on user requirements.
    Web3 Integration: The agent should interact with the blockchain via an API (using Web3.py).
    Backend Logic: The backend should handle user requirements, fetch the data, interact with APIs and blockchains, and process it.

We’ll break down the implementation into the following steps:

    Set up the SQL Agent: Fetching data from an SQL database.
    Set up the Web3 Integration: Using Web3.py to interact with a blockchain.
    Creating the Python Web Server: Using Flask to integrate both SQL agent and Web3 functionality.

Step 1: Set up SQL Agent (fetching data from the database)

First, we need to fetch data from an SQL database based on the user requirements. Let’s assume you’re using a MySQL database.

import mysql.connector

# Connect to the MySQL database
def connect_db():
    return mysql.connector.connect(
        host="localhost",  # Update with your DB host
        user="yourusername",  # Update with your DB username
        password="yourpassword",  # Update with your DB password
        database="yourdatabase"  # Update with your DB name
    )

def fetch_data_from_sql(query, params=None):
    conn = connect_db()
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, params or ())
        result = cursor.fetchall()
    except mysql.connector.Error as err:
        print(f"Error: {err}")
        result = []
    finally:
        cursor.close()
        conn.close()
    
    return result

# Example usage: Fetch all user data
def get_user_data():
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = %s"
    return fetch_data_from_sql(query, ('1',))

Step 2: Set up Web3 Integration

Install Web3.py if you haven't already:

pip install web3

Now, you can set up a simple function that interacts with an Ethereum-based blockchain using Web3.py. Let’s assume you’re interacting with the Ethereum network.

from web3 import Web3

# Connect to an Ethereum node (either via Infura or your own node)
w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider("https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID"))

def check_wallet_balance(address):
    try:
        # Ensure the connection to Web3 is successful
        if w3.isConnected():
            balance = w3.eth.get_balance(address)  # Get balance in Wei
            return w3.fromWei(balance, 'ether')  # Convert to Ether
        else:
            print("Web3 connection failed")
            return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching wallet balance: {e}")
        return None

Step 3: Combining SQL Agent and Web3 Integration in a Flask Application

Now, we combine both the SQL agent and Web3 functionalities in a simple Flask app. The app will listen for user queries, fetch the required data from the SQL database, and if needed, interact with the blockchain.

First, install Flask:

pip install flask

Now, create a basic Flask app:

from flask import Flask, jsonify, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/get-user-data", methods=["GET"])
def get_user_data():
    # Fetch the user's data from SQL database based on query
    user_data = get_user_data()
    return jsonify(user_data)

@app.route("/get-wallet-balance", methods=["GET"])
def get_wallet_balance():
    # Fetch wallet balance from the blockchain
    wallet_address = request.args.get("address")
    if wallet_address:
        balance = check_wallet_balance(wallet_address)
        if balance is not None:
            return jsonify({"address": wallet_address, "balance": balance})
        else:
            return jsonify({"error": "Failed to fetch wallet balance"})
    else:
        return jsonify({"error": "No address provided"})


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

Explanation of the Flask API:

    Route /get-user-data: This endpoint fetches data from an SQL database based on the query, using the get_user_data function (which you can customize).

    Route /get-wallet-balance: This endpoint fetches the balance from a blockchain wallet address. You pass the wallet address as a query parameter (e.g., /get-wallet-balance?address=0xabc123...).

Step 4: Connecting SQL and Web3 with User Requests

The app is now capable of handling user requests related to fetching data from an SQL database and blockchain interactions. You can extend this system to handle more sophisticated logic like querying the blockchain for smart contract data or handling user interactions for data-fetching dynamically.
Additional Notes:

    Security: Be careful with sensitive data when interacting with the blockchain (wallet addresses, private keys, etc.). Use secure practices for user authentication and data handling.
    Error Handling: Proper error handling is required, especially for blockchain interactions, as network failures can occur.
    Scalability: Depending on the complexity of the requests, you may need to optimize your code and use more scalable databases and blockchain integrations (e.g., querying specific smart contracts).
    Cloud Integration: For cloud deployment, consider using AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions for deploying your Flask app, and integrate it with cloud-based databases or decentralized storage if needed.

Conclusion:

This setup allows you to:

    Fetch user-specific data from an SQL database.
    Interact with blockchain networks (Ethereum in this case) to fetch wallet balances.
    Expose both functionalities through a simple REST API.

You can further extend this application by adding more sophisticated database queries, handling smart contract interactions, or integrating AI models to process the data.
